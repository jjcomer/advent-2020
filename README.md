# Advent of Code 2020

I'm doubling down on AoC this year and attempting to solve in both clojure and rust!

## Usage

### Rust

Install `cargo-aoc` https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc

``` shell
cargo install cargo-aoc
```

Days can be executed using:

``` shell
cargo aoc -d <num>
```

### Clj

Choose your favourite editor from this list: Emacs

Start up a repl and execute the `solve-part-x` for each day. The repo is setup such that the clojure code will use the input downloaded by `cargo-aoc`.
